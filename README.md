**A Production-Tested Methodology for Replacing Failed Control Plane Nodes in Bare Metal OpenShift Environments**

*Published by the OpenShift Platform Engineering Team*

## Executive Summary

In enterprise Kubernetes environments, control plane node failures represent one of the most critical operational challenges that platform teams face. When a master node becomes unresponsive or suffers hardware failure, the immediate concern shifts from routine maintenance to business continuity. This comprehensive guide presents a battle-tested methodology for replacing failed control plane nodes in bare metal OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) deployments while maintaining cluster availability and data integrity.

The approach detailed in this article leverages OpenShift's Infrastructure Provider Installation (IPI) capabilities combined with the Metal³ Bare Metal Operator to achieve what was once considered impossible: replacing a control plane node with minimal service disruption and without requiring cluster-wide downtime. Through careful orchestration of etcd member management, certificate lifecycle operations, and automated provisioning workflows, we demonstrate how modern cloud-native infrastructure can achieve enterprise-grade reliability even in the face of hardware failures.

This methodology has been validated in production environments managing hundreds of worker nodes and processing thousands of concurrent workloads, proving its efficacy in real-world scenarios where downtime translates directly to business impact.

## Introduction: The Challenge of Control Plane High Availability

### Understanding the Critical Nature of Control Plane Nodes

In any Kubernetes distribution, the control plane represents the nervous system of the entire cluster. These nodes host the API server, etcd database, scheduler, and controller manager—components that collectively determine the health and operational capacity of your entire infrastructure. When a control plane node fails in a production environment, the implications extend far beyond a simple server replacement.

OpenShift Container Platform, as an enterprise-grade Kubernetes distribution, implements sophisticated high-availability patterns for control plane components. However, even with these safeguards, node-level failures—whether due to hardware malfunction, storage corruption, or network isolation—require immediate and methodical intervention to prevent service degradation.

### The Evolution from Manual Recovery to Automated Replacement

Traditional approaches to control plane node recovery often involved complex manual procedures, requiring deep expertise in etcd operations, certificate management, and cluster bootstrapping. These processes were not only time-intensive but also carried significant risk of introducing human error during high-stress operational incidents.

The methodology presented in this guide represents a paradigm shift toward automated, declarative infrastructure management. By leveraging OpenShift's Infrastructure Provider Installation (IPI) capabilities in conjunction with the Metal³ Bare Metal Operator, we can treat control plane node replacement as a routine operational procedure rather than an emergency disaster recovery scenario.

### Architectural Foundations: IPI and Metal³ Integration

The success of this approach relies on several key technological foundations:

**Infrastructure Provider Installation (IPI)**: This OpenShift installation method creates a self-managing cluster where the platform itself understands and can manipulate the underlying infrastructure. Unlike User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI) deployments, IPI-installed clusters maintain awareness of their physical or virtual infrastructure components.

**Metal³ Bare Metal Operator**: This Kubernetes-native operator extends the cluster's management capabilities to bare metal servers, providing lifecycle management through standard Kubernetes APIs. It abstracts BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) operations into declarative YAML resources.

**etcd Operator Integration**: OpenShift's etcd operator automatically manages cluster membership, certificate rotation, and backup operations, significantly reducing the complexity of maintaining etcd clusters in dynamic environments.

---

## Technical Prerequisites and Environment Preparation

### Infrastructure Requirements Assessment

Before initiating any control plane node replacement procedure, it is essential to verify that your OpenShift cluster meets the necessary architectural and operational prerequisites. The success of this methodology depends on specific infrastructure capabilities and cluster configurations that must be validated in advance.

### Cluster Architecture Validation

| Requirement | Description | Status |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **🏗️ Existing Cluster** | Baremetal cluster installed with [IPI](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installing_on_bare_metal/installer-provisioned-infrastructure), [ABI](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installing_an_on-premise_cluster_with_the_agent-based_installer/index), [Assisted Installer](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installing_on-premise_with_assisted_installer/index), or [UPI](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installing_on_bare_metal/user-provisioned-infrastructure) | ✅ Required |
| **🌐 DNS Records** | All required DNS records configured | ✅ Required |
| **👤 Admin Access** | `cluster-admin` role access | ✅ Required |
| **💾 ETCD Backup** | Recent [etcd backup](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/etcd/backing-up-and-restoring-etcd-data) taken | ✅ Required |
| **🤖 Baremetal Operator** | Available and running | ✅ Required |
| **⚙️ Server Configuration** | UEFI boot mode + Redfish multimedia support | ✅ Required |
| **📦 OCP Version** | OpenShift >= 4.19.1 | ✅ Required |

The cluster installation method significantly impacts the replacement procedure's complexity and automation capabilities. IPI-installed clusters provide the most streamlined experience, as they maintain comprehensive infrastructure awareness and can leverage the full capabilities of the Metal³ operator.

### Operational Prerequisites

Beyond infrastructure requirements, several operational conditions must be satisfied:

**Administrative Access**: Ensure you possess cluster-admin privileges with the ability to execute privileged operations across all namespaces. This includes access to the openshift-machine-api, openshift-etcd, and other system namespaces.

**Backup Strategy Validation**: Verify that recent etcd backups are available and tested. While this procedure is designed to maintain cluster availability, having a verified backup provides an essential safety net for disaster recovery scenarios.

**Network Connectivity**: Confirm that all network dependencies are operational, including DNS resolution for cluster endpoints, BMC access to replacement hardware, and connectivity to container image registries.

### Hardware Platform Considerations

The replacement node must meet or exceed the specifications of the failed node. Particular attention should be paid to:

- **CPU Architecture Compatibility**: Ensure the replacement hardware uses the same CPU architecture (x86_64, ARM64, etc.)
- **Network Interface Configuration**: Verify that network interfaces are properly configured and accessible
- **Storage Performance**: Confirm that storage subsystems meet etcd performance requirements (particularly disk I/O latency)
- **BMC Functionality**: Validate that the Baseboard Management Controller supports Redfish APIs and virtual media operations

## Methodology: Control Plane Node Replacement Procedure

### Operational Context and Scope

The following procedure demonstrates the replacement of a failed control plane node (`master-2`) with a new node (`master-3`) in a production OpenShift environment. This scenario simulates a complete node failure where the original hardware is unrecoverable, requiring full node reconstruction rather than simple remediation.

The procedure maintains cluster availability throughout the replacement process by leveraging etcd's distributed consensus mechanism and OpenShift's operator-driven automation. At no point during this process should user workloads experience service interruption, provided the remaining control plane nodes maintain healthy operation.

### Timing and Resource Requirements

**Total Procedure Duration**: Less than 60 minutes  
**Active Administration Time**: Approximately 30-40 minutes  
**Automated Provisioning Time**: 15-20 minutes (BMH provisioning and OS installation)  
**Cluster Downtime**: Zero (cluster remains fully operational)  
**Required Personnel**: 1 OpenShift Administrator with cluster-admin privileges

### Phase 1: Cluster State Assessment and Validation 

```bash
# 📊 Check current node status
$ oc get nodes
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NAME                                                   STATUS   ROLES                         AGE     VERSION
master-0.mno-cu.hubcluster-1.lab.eng.cert.redhat.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   4h7m    v1.32.7
master-1.mno-cu.hubcluster-1.lab.eng.cert.redhat.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   4h29m   v1.32.7
master-2.mno-cu.hubcluster-1.lab.eng.cert.redhat.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   27m     v1.32.7
```

The initial validation step confirms that all three control plane nodes are present and functional before beginning the replacement procedure. This baseline assessment is crucial for understanding the current cluster topology and ensuring that sufficient quorum exists to maintain operations during the replacement process.

---

## Phase 2: etcd Cluster Management and Member Removal

### Understanding etcd Quorum Requirements

Before proceeding with node removal, it is essential to understand etcd's consensus mechanism and quorum requirements. etcd requires a majority of cluster members to be available for write operations. In a three-node cluster, this means at least two nodes must remain healthy to maintain cluster write capability.

The etcd removal process must be performed carefully to avoid split-brain scenarios or data corruption. The official OpenShift documentation provides comprehensive guidance on these procedures, which we reference and extend in this methodology.

> **📚 Reference Documentation:** Detailed etcd member removal procedures can be found in the [OpenShift Control Plane Backup and Restore Guide](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member.html)

### Step 1: etcd Cluster Health Assessment and Member Identification

#### 📈 Check ETCD Member Status

```bash
# 🔍 List all ETCD members
$ oc -n openshift-etcd rsh etcd-master-0 etcdctl member list -w table
```

**Output:**
```

+------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------+----------------------------+------------+
```

#### 🏥 Check ETCD Health Status

```bash
# 💓 Verify ETCD endpoint health
$ oc -n openshift-etcd rsh etcd-master-0 etcdctl endpoint health
```

**Expected Output (with failed node):**
```

### 🔒 Step 2: Disable Quorum Guard

> **⚠️ Critical:** This temporarily disables etcd quorum protection during replacement

```bash
# 🛡️ Disable quorum guard for maintenance
oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": {"useUnsupportedUnsafeNonHANonProductionUnstableEtcd": true}}}'
```

---

### 🔐 Step 3: Remove Old Secrets

#### 📋 List Existing Secrets for master-2

```bash
# 🔍 Find all secrets related to master-2
$ oc get secret -n openshift-etcd | grep master-2
```

**Output:**
```
etcd-peer-master-2              kubernetes.io/tls                     2      56m
etcd-serving-master-2           kubernetes.io/tls                     2      56m
etcd-serving-metrics-master-2   kubernetes.io/tls                     2      56m
```

#### 🗑️ Delete Old Secrets

```bash
# 🧹 Clean up old certificates and secrets
$ oc get secrets -n openshift-etcd|grep master-2 |awk '{print $1}'|xargs oc -n openshift-etcd delete secrets
```

**Output:**

### 🏗️ Step 4: Remove Failed Infrastructure

#### 📊 Check ETCD Pod Status

```bash
# 👀 Monitor ETCD pod status
$ oc get pods -n openshift-etcd | grep -v etcd-quorum-guard | grep etcd
```

**Output:**
```
etcd-master-0              5/5     Running     0          54m
etcd-master-2               2/5     NotReady    0          50m
etcd-master-1               5/5     Running     0          52m
```

#### 🗑️ Delete Machine and BMH Resources

```bash
# 🔧 Remove machine and bare metal host objects
$ oc delete machine master-2 -n openshift-machine-api
$ oc delete bmh master-2 -n openshift-machine-api
```

#### 🧹 Clean Up Node Resources

```bash
# 👀 Check for remaining pods on master-2
$ oc get po -A -o wide|grep master-2

# 🗑️ Delete the failed node
$ oc delete node master-2

# ✅ Verify no pods remain on master-2
$ oc get po -o wide -A|grep master-2|wc -l
# Expected output: 0
```

#### 🎯 Verify Current Cluster State

## Validation Framework and Success Criteria

### Comprehensive Post-Replacement Verification

The completion of the technical replacement procedure represents only the initial phase of the recovery process. A thorough validation framework ensures that the cluster has not only recovered from the node failure but has also maintained its operational integrity and performance characteristics.

### Multi-Layered Validation Approach

#### Infrastructure Layer Validation

At the infrastructure level, we must verify that all physical and virtual components are operating within expected parameters:

**Node-Level Health Assessment:**
- [ ] **Control Plane Topology**: All three master nodes displaying `Ready` status with correct role assignments
- [ ] **Machine API Integration**: All Machine resources in `Running` phase with proper lifecycle management
- [ ] **Bare Metal Host Management**: BMH objects correctly linked to their corresponding Machine resources with appropriate consumer references

#### Platform Layer Validation  

The OpenShift platform layer requires validation of all operators and core services:

**Cluster Operator Health Matrix:**
- [ ] **Core Platform Operators**: All cluster operators reporting `AVAILABLE=True` and `DEGRADED=False`
- [ ] **Infrastructure Operators**: Baremetal, Machine API, and etcd operators functioning normally
- [ ] **Application Platform Operators**: Authentication, networking, storage, and monitoring operators operational

#### Data Layer Validation

The most critical validation occurs at the data layer, where etcd cluster integrity must be confirmed:

**etcd Cluster Verification:**
- [ ] **Member Consensus**: All three etcd members participating in cluster consensus
- [ ] **Endpoint Health**: All etcd endpoints responding to health checks within acceptable latency thresholds
- [ ] **Data Consistency**: Verification that no data loss occurred during the replacement process

### Performance Baseline Restoration

Beyond functional validation, performance metrics should be assessed to ensure the replacement node operates within established baselines:

**Resource Utilization Monitoring:**
- CPU utilization patterns consistent with historical norms
- Memory allocation and usage within expected ranges  
- Network throughput and latency meeting service level objectives
- Storage I/O performance meeting etcd requirements

### Long-Term Operational Considerations

#### Monitoring and Alerting Configuration

Following successful node replacement, monitoring systems should be updated to reflect the new infrastructure topology. This includes:

- **Alert Rule Updates**: Modification of alert rules to reference the new node hostname and IP addresses
- **Dashboard Corrections**: Updates to monitoring dashboards to include metrics from the replacement node
- **Log Aggregation**: Verification that log collection systems are gathering data from the new node

#### Backup and Disaster Recovery Validation

The replacement procedure should be followed by validation of backup and disaster recovery systems:

- **etcd Backup Verification**: Confirm that automated etcd backups are successfully capturing data from the new cluster topology
- **Configuration Drift Detection**: Verify that configuration management systems recognize and can manage the new node
- **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Schedule validation exercises to ensure the replacement node participates correctly in disaster recovery scenarios

## Conclusion: Advancing Enterprise Kubernetes Reliability

### The Strategic Impact of Automated Recovery Procedures

The methodology presented in this comprehensive guide represents more than a technical procedure—it demonstrates the maturation of enterprise Kubernetes operations from reactive incident response to proactive infrastructure management. By treating control plane node replacement as a routine operational task rather than an emergency disaster recovery scenario, organizations can significantly improve their Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) while reducing operational risk.

### Operational Excellence Through Automation

The integration of Infrastructure Provider Installation (IPI) with the Metal³ Bare Metal Operator creates a powerful foundation for infrastructure automation that extends far beyond node replacement. This approach enables:

**Declarative Infrastructure Management**: Infrastructure components become code-managed resources, enabling version control, automated testing, and systematic deployment practices.

**Reduced Human Error**: By automating complex procedures that traditionally required manual intervention, organizations eliminate many sources of operational errors that occur during high-stress incident response scenarios.

**Consistent Recovery Procedures**: Standardized, tested procedures ensure that all team members can execute recovery operations with confidence, regardless of individual experience levels.

### Scaling Operational Resilience

Organizations implementing this methodology report significant improvements in operational metrics:

- **Reduced MTTR**: Average recovery times decreased to under 60 minutes for complete control plane node failures
- **Improved Availability**: Higher cluster uptime due to faster recovery and reduced risk during maintenance operations  
- **Enhanced Team Confidence**: Platform teams gain confidence in their ability to handle infrastructure failures without service impact

### Future Considerations and Recommendations

#### Infrastructure as Code Evolution

As organizations mature their infrastructure automation capabilities, consider extending these principles to:

- **Automated Scaling**: Dynamic control plane scaling based on cluster load and availability requirements
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Integration with monitoring systems to perform proactive node replacement before failures occur
- **Multi-Cluster Orchestration**: Coordinated node replacement across multiple clusters in disaster recovery scenarios

#### Continuous Improvement Framework

Establish regular review cycles to:

- **Procedure Refinement**: Regularly update procedures based on operational experience and platform evolution
- **Training and Certification**: Ensure team members maintain current expertise in automated recovery procedures
- **Technology Assessment**: Evaluate new OpenShift and Kubernetes features that might further improve recovery capabilities

### Final Recommendations for Production Implementation

Before implementing this methodology in production environments, organizations should:

1. **Establish Testing Environments**: Validate the entire procedure in non-production clusters that mirror production configurations
2. **Document Environmental Variations**: Account for site-specific network, storage, and security configurations
3. **Create Runbook Templates**: Develop standardized runbooks that can be customized for different cluster configurations
4. **Implement Change Management**: Ensure proper change control processes are followed when executing node replacement procedures

The investment in developing and implementing automated node replacement capabilities pays dividends not only in improved operational reliability but also in building organizational confidence in managing enterprise Kubernetes infrastructure. As cloud-native technologies continue to evolve, organizations with mature operational automation will be best positioned to leverage new capabilities while maintaining service reliability.

## Executive Summary

In Kubernetes environments, control plane node failures represent one of the most critical operational challenges that platform teams face. When a master node becomes unresponsive or suffers hardware failure, the immediate concern shifts from routine maintenance to business continuity. This comprehensive guide presents a battle-tested methodology for replacing failed control plane nodes in bare metal OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) deployments while maintaining cluster availability and data integrity.

The approach detailed in this article leverages OpenShift's Infrastructure Provider Installation (IPI) capabilities combined with the Metal³ Bare Metal Operator to achieve what was once considered impossible: replacing a control plane node with minimal service disruption and without requiring cluster-wide downtime. Through careful orchestration of etcd member management, certificate lifecycle operations, and automated provisioning workflows, we demonstrate how modern cloud-native infrastructure can achieve enterprise-grade reliability even in the face of hardware failures.

This methodology has been validated in production environments managing hundreds of worker nodes and processing thousands of concurrent workloads, proving its efficacy in real-world scenarios where downtime translates directly to business impact.

## Introduction: The Challenge of Control Plane High Availability

### Understanding the Critical Nature of Control Plane Nodes

In any Kubernetes distribution, the control plane represents the nervous system of the entire cluster. These nodes host the API server, etcd database, scheduler, and controller manager—components that collectively determine the health and operational capacity of your entire infrastructure. When a control plane node fails in a production environment, the implications extend far beyond a simple server replacement.

OpenShift Container Platform, as an enterprise-grade Kubernetes distribution, implements sophisticated high-availability patterns for control plane components. However, even with these safeguards, node-level failures—whether due to hardware malfunction, storage corruption, or network isolation—require immediate and methodical intervention to prevent service degradation.


### Architectural Foundations: IPI and Metal³ Integration

The success of this approach relies on several key technological foundations:

**Infrastructure Provider Installation (IPI)**: This OpenShift installation method creates a self-managing cluster where the platform itself understands and can manipulate the underlying infrastructure. Unlike User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI) deployments, IPI-installed clusters maintain awareness of their physical or virtual infrastructure components.

**Metal³ Bare Metal Operator**: This Kubernetes-native operator extends the cluster's management capabilities to bare metal servers, providing lifecycle management through standard Kubernetes APIs. It abstracts BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) operations into declarative YAML resources.

**etcd Operator Integration**: OpenShift's etcd operator automatically manages cluster membership, certificate rotation, and backup operations, significantly reducing the complexity of maintaining etcd clusters in dynamic environments.

---

## Technical Prerequisites and Environment Preparation

### Infrastructure Requirements Assessment

Before initiating any control plane node replacement procedure, it is essential to verify that your OpenShift cluster meets the necessary architectural and operational prerequisites. The success of this methodology depends on specific infrastructure capabilities and cluster configurations that must be validated in advance.

### Cluster Architecture Validation

| Requirement | Description | Status |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **🏗️ Existing Cluster** | Baremetal cluster installed with [IPI](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installing_on_bare_metal/installer-provisioned-infrastructure), [ABI](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installing_an_on-premise_cluster_with_the_agent-based_installer/index), [Assisted Installer](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installing_on-premise_with_assisted_installer/index), or [UPI](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installing_on_bare_metal/user-provisioned-infrastructure) | ✅ Required |
| **🌐 DNS Records** | All required DNS records configured | ✅ Required |
| **👤 Admin Access** | `cluster-admin` role access | ✅ Required |
| **💾 ETCD Backup** | Recent [etcd backup](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/etcd/backing-up-and-restoring-etcd-data) taken | ✅ Required |
| **🤖 Baremetal Operator** | Available and running | ✅ Required |
| **⚙️ Server Configuration** | UEFI boot mode + Redfish multimedia support | ✅ Required |
| **📦 OCP Version** | OpenShift >= 4.19.1 | ✅ Required |

The cluster installation method significantly impacts the replacement procedure's complexity and automation capabilities. IPI-installed clusters provide the most streamlined experience, as they maintain comprehensive infrastructure awareness and can leverage the full capabilities of the Metal³ operator.

### Operational Prerequisites

Beyond infrastructure requirements, several operational conditions must be satisfied:

**Administrative Access**: Ensure you possess cluster-admin privileges with the ability to execute privileged operations across all namespaces. This includes access to the openshift-machine-api, openshift-etcd, and other system namespaces.

**Backup Strategy Validation**: Verify that recent etcd backups are available and tested. While this procedure is designed to maintain cluster availability, having a verified backup provides an essential safety net for disaster recovery scenarios.

**Network Connectivity**: Confirm that all network dependencies are operational, including DNS resolution for cluster endpoints, BMC access to replacement hardware, and connectivity to container image registries.

### Hardware Platform Considerations

The replacement node must meet or exceed the specifications of the failed node. Particular attention should be paid to:

- **CPU Architecture Compatibility**: Ensure the replacement hardware uses the same CPU architecture (x86_64, ARM64, AMD64 etc.)
- **Network Interface Configuration**: Verify that network interfaces are properly configured and accessible
- **Storage Performance**: Confirm that storage subsystems meet etcd performance requirements (particularly disk I/O latency)
- **BMC Functionality**: Validate that the Baseboard Management Controller supports Redfish APIs and virtual media operations

## Methodology: Control Plane Node Replacement Procedure

### Operational Context and Scope

The following procedure demonstrates the replacement of a failed control plane node (`master-2`) with a new node (`master-3`) in a production OpenShift environment. This scenario simulates a complete node failure where the original hardware is unrecoverable, requiring full node reconstruction rather than simple remediation.

The procedure maintains cluster availability throughout the replacement process by leveraging etcd's distributed consensus mechanism and OpenShift's operator-driven automation. At no point during this process should user workloads experience service interruption, provided the remaining control plane nodes maintain healthy operation.

### Timing and Resource Requirements

**Total Procedure Duration**: Approximately 60-80 minutes  
**Active Administration Time**: Approximately 20-30 minutes  
**Automated Provisioning Time**: 30-40 minutes (BMH provisioning and OS installation)  
**Cluster Downtime**: Zero (cluster remains fully operational)  
**Required Personnel**: 1 OpenShift Administrator with cluster-admin privileges

### Phase 1: Cluster State Assessment and Validation 

```bash
# 📊 Check current node status
$ oc get nodes
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NAME                                                   STATUS   ROLES                         AGE     VERSION
master-0.mno-cu.hubcluster-1.lab.eng.cert.redhat.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   4h7m    v1.32.7
master-1.mno-cu.hubcluster-1.lab.eng.cert.redhat.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   4h29m   v1.32.7
master-2.mno-cu.hubcluster-1.lab.eng.cert.redhat.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   27m     v1.32.7
```

The initial validation step confirms that all three control plane nodes are present and functional before beginning the replacement procedure. This baseline assessment is crucial for understanding the current cluster topology and ensuring that sufficient quorum exists to maintain operations during the replacement process.

---

## Phase 2: etcd Cluster Management and Member Removal

### Understanding etcd Quorum Requirements

Before proceeding with node removal, it is essential to understand etcd's consensus mechanism and quorum requirements. etcd requires a majority of cluster members to be available for write operations. In a three-node cluster, this means at least two nodes must remain healthy to maintain cluster write capability.

The etcd removal process must be performed carefully to avoid split-brain scenarios or data corruption. The official OpenShift documentation provides comprehensive guidance on these procedures, which we reference and extend in this methodology.

> **📚 Reference Documentation:** Detailed etcd member removal procedures can be found in the [OpenShift Control Plane Backup and Restore Guide](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member.html)

### Step 1: etcd Cluster Health Assessment and Member Identification

#### 📈 Check ETCD Member Status

```bash
# 🔍 List all ETCD members
$ oc -n openshift-etcd rsh etcd-master-0 etcdctl member list -w table
```

**Output:**
```

+------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------+----------------------------+------------+
```

#### 🏥 Check ETCD Health Status

```bash
# 💓 Verify ETCD endpoint health
$ oc -n openshift-etcd rsh etcd-master-0 etcdctl endpoint health
```

**Expected Output (with failed node):**
```

https://192.168.24.86:2379 is unhealthy: failed to commit proposal: context deadline exceeded
Error: unhealthy cluster
```

> **⚠️ Important:** Note the `master-2` member-ID (`6fd2f8909c811461`) for the next step

#### 🗑️ Remove ETCD master-2 Member

```bash
# 🔧 Connect to ETCD pod and remove failed member
$ oc -n openshift-etcd rsh etcd-master-0 
sh-4.4# etcdctl member list
sh-4.4# etcdctl member remove 6fd2f8909c811461
```

**Output:**
```
Member 6fd2f8909c811461 removed from cluster c413f45f7dfe9590
```

#### ✅ Verify Member Removal

```bash
# 📋 Confirm master-2 is no longer listed
sh-4.4# etcdctl member list -w table
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------+----------------------------+------------+

### 🔒 Step 2: Disable Quorum Guard

> **⚠️ Critical:** This temporarily disables etcd quorum protection during replacement

```bash
# 🛡️ Disable quorum guard for maintenance
oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": {"useUnsupportedUnsafeNonHANonProductionUnstableEtcd": true}}}'
```

---

### 🔐 Step 3: Remove Old Secrets

#### 📋 List Existing Secrets for master-2

```bash
# 🔍 Find all secrets related to master-2
$ oc get secret -n openshift-etcd | grep master-2
```

**Output:**
```
etcd-peer-master-2              kubernetes.io/tls                     2      56m
etcd-serving-master-2           kubernetes.io/tls                     2      56m
etcd-serving-metrics-master-2   kubernetes.io/tls                     2      56m
```

#### 🗑️ Delete Old Secrets

```bash
# 🧹 Clean up old certificates and secrets
$ oc get secrets -n openshift-etcd|grep master-2 |awk '{print $1}'|xargs oc -n openshift-etcd delete secrets
```

**Output:**
```
secret "etcd-peer-master-2" deleted
secret "etcd-serving-master-2" deleted
secret "etcd-serving-metrics-master-2" deleted
```

---

### 🏗️ Step 4: Remove Failed Infrastructure

#### 📊 Check ETCD Pod Status

```bash
# 👀 Monitor ETCD pod status
$ oc get pods -n openshift-etcd | grep -v etcd-quorum-guard | grep etcd
```

**Output:**
```
etcd-master-0              5/5     Running     0          54m
etcd-master-2               2/5     NotReady    0          50m
etcd-master-1               5/5     Running     0          52m
```

#### 🗑️ Delete Machine and BMH Resources

```bash
# 🔧 Remove machine and bare metal host objects
$ oc delete machine master-2 -n openshift-machine-api
$ oc delete bmh master-2 -n openshift-machine-api
```

#### 🧹 Clean Up Node Resources

```bash
# 👀 Check for remaining pods on master-2
$ oc get po -A -o wide|grep master-2

# 🗑️ Delete the failed node
$ oc delete node master-2

# ✅ Verify no pods remain on master-2
$ oc get po -o wide -A|grep master-2|wc -l
# Expected output: 0
```

#### 🎯 Verify Current Cluster State

```bash

## Conclusion

This methodology demonstrates how modern OpenShift deployments can achieve enterprise-grade reliability through automated control plane node replacement. By leveraging Infrastructure Provider Installation (IPI) with the Metal³ Bare Metal Operator, organizations can replace failed control plane nodes in 60-80 minutes with zero cluster downtime.

### Key Benefits

**Reduced Recovery Time**: Complete node replacement in approximately 60-80 minutes compared to traditional multi-hour procedures.

**Zero Downtime**: Cluster remains fully operational throughout the replacement process, ensuring business continuity.

**Automated Process**: Standardized procedures reduce human error and enable consistent recovery operations across team members.

### Implementation Recommendations

Before deploying in production:

1. **Test in Non-Production**: Validate the complete procedure in environments that mirror production configurations
2. **Document Site-Specific Variations**: Account for local network, storage, and security requirements  
3. **Train Operations Teams**: Ensure team members are familiar with the automated recovery procedures
4. **Establish Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring to detect node failures quickly

This approach transforms control plane node replacement from an emergency disaster recovery scenario into a routine operational procedure, significantly improving organizational confidence in managing enterprise Kubernetes infrastructure.
